# ImageSim

ImageSim is a small WPF desktop application intended for searching duplicates or similar images on your PC. Image similarity calculation is based on perceptual hash. Implementations of perceptual hashes are ported from [pHash lib](www.phash.org).

## Usage

Add your files to the app and run any of algorithms, listed in `Tools` menu. Calculated hashes are stored on disc saving time on subsequent runs.
